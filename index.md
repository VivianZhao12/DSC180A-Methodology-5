**Learning and Using Causal Knowledge for Advancing Al and Scientific
Discovery**
with mentors Biwei Huang and Jelena Bradic

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br />
In the beginning of the quarter, our mentors went over how some of the causal algorithms determine the skeleton of relations between many variables. This process gave me insights into what the algorithm is doing (when i am waiting forever for it to run) behind the scenes.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br />
In Quarter 2, I would like to apply what we learned this quarter about different causal algorithms to the stocks and trade industry. I am curious to see what macroeconomic indicators effect stock prices.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br />
This quarter, our goal is to be familiar with each algorithm and their specialties. As a result our data used was simulated and we have a ground truth graph for it. Next quarter, I am hoping to apply this knowledge to real world data and discover some new causal insights in certain fields.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** <br />
Besides using the Causal Learn packages as we did this quarter, I am interested to go through large data processing next quarter and discover some more methods on the way.
